# 📝 TaskFlow – Drag & Drop Task Manager

**TaskFlow** is a simple and responsive task management web app that helps you visually organize tasks across four key stages:

- 🟦 To Do  
- 🟨 In Progress  
- 🟧 Under Review  
- 🟩 Finished

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📌 Add new tasks through a centered popup modal  
- 🖱️ Drag and drop tasks between columns  
- 🎯 Clean, minimal UI  
- 🛠️ Built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript  

> 🔧 Future updates will include task **deletion**, **editing**, and **filtering** capabilities.

## 📂 Project Structure

taskflow/
├── index.html # Main HTML file
├── style.css # CSS styles for layout and design
└── script.js # JS for task handling and drag/drop

## 💡 Inspiration

Inspired by Kanban-style tools like **Trello**, **TaskFlow** is built completely from scratch using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript** — no frameworks.  
It’s designed to be a clean and focused alternative for personal task tracking or for learning how drag-and-drop works in web development.
